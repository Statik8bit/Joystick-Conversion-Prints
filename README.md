# Joystick-Conversion-Prints
Parts to convert OEM Colecovision Controllers to something I find more useful. These are still a work in progress but I'm happy with it enough to realease it here.

I've created to Joystick caps that fit over the existing OEM joystick knobs.  Print one and let me know how it works statik8bitcomputer@gmail.com
I will make prints of any of my projects and mail them to you contact statik8bitcomputer@gmail.com

I'm working on another print to replace the OEM stick entirely to be more solid.

3D printing notes.  I Printed with a brim, rafts also seem to work.  I used 50% fill, with 2 outside wall layers and 4 layers on the top.  I used the finest print height available. I used supports touching baseplate only.
